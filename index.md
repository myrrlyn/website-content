## Introduction

I’m a programmer and Scout leader currently living in Madison, Wisconsin. When
I’m not at work or in the wilderness, I like to [write Rust][crates], SCUBA
dive, woodwork, tell my cat how good he is, drive across the continent, and
listen to way, way too much girlpop.

I work at the Sub-Zero Group as a senior embedded software engineer, where I
develop oven control and interface software. I’m very excited to be returning to
my embedded and human-tool roots! I am not currently looking for other
opportunities.

I’ve previously worked as a software engineer at [Fastly] on the [H2O web
server][h2o], at [Amazon Web Services][AWS] bringing Rust to embedded devices,
and at [Space Dynamics Laboratory] building and operating research small
satellites. My [long-form résumé][resume] (PDF) is available if you’re
interested in reading it.

I also volunteer with a local Scout troop, where I teach aquatics and wilderness
first aid.

## Contact Info

You may reach me through any of the methods listed here. My phone number, like
that of most Americans, is relentlessly spammed so I don’t broadcast it anymore.

- [Email] (I receive mail sent to any `@myrrlyn.net` address; feel free
  to play around with that if you want)
- [Twitter] / [Mastodon]{:rel="me"} / [BlueSky]
- [GitHub]
- [Reddit]
- [Discord] (`myrrlyn`, formerly `myrrlyn#0611`)
- [Instagram]
- [Snapchat]
- [LinkedIn] (I almost never maintain this)
- [Keybase]

I use the screen name “myrrlyn” pretty much everywhere, so if you find that name
somewhere I haven’t listed here, it’s still probably me!

<!-- - [Public Key][pubkey] -->

If you _do_ have my phone number, you _should_, but by no means _must_, use
[Signal] to text me. Again, it’s more a habit thing than anything else; normal
texts are also fine.

## Social Policy

I have believed in the virtues of a strong and diverse social graph since the
day I moved to Utah and found myself without any local friends. Please feel free
to interact with me through any of these media and I will do my best to respond
in kind.

If you are geographically near† me, I will gladly hang out with you at least
twice in any setting you like. I am fine with catching a meal or drinks, and I
always love anything outdoors or otherwise scenic. I am a fairly tall man and I
recognize what this implies for a lot of people’s decision-making process, so
here are some explicit promises:

- I will never ask for a non-public setting, nor will I approach to within my
  arms’ reach without invitation.
- At your discretion, you may freely suggest a less than public setting, or step
  closer.
- I will not initiate physical contact but I accept the usual American fare of
  handshakes and hugs.

†: I have a relatively loose definition of “near”, and I usually broadcast my
movements on Twitter. This offer absolutely stands when I am traveling as well
as when I am home.
