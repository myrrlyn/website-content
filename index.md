## Introduction

I’m a programmer and Boy Scout currently living in Madison, Wisconsin. When I’m
not at work or in the wilderness, I like to [write Rust][crates], SCUBA dive,
woodwork, tell my cat how good he is, drive across the continent, and listen to
way, way too much girlpop.

I am currently looking for my next opportunity! You can read my long-form
[résumé] to see if I would be a good fit for your company.

I’ve previously worked as a software engineer at Fastly on the H2O web server,
at Amazon Web Services bringing Rust to embedded devices, and at Space
Dynamics Laboratory building and operating research small-satellites.

I also volunteer with a local Scout troop, teaching aquatics and wilderness
travel.

## Contact Info

You may reach me through any of the methods listed here. My phone number, like
that of most Americans, is relentlessly spammed so I don’t broadcast it anymore.
You are welcome, but by no means required, to use my public key. It’s a good
idea but an irritating practice.

- [Email][email]
- [Twitter][twitter] (I probably am not active on this anymore)
- [Mastodon][mastodon]{:rel="me"}
- [GitHub][gh]
- [Cohost][cohost]
- [Reddit][reddit]
- [Discord][discord] (`myrrlyn#0611`)
- [Instagram][ig]
- [Snapchat][snap]
- [LinkedIn][linkedin] (I almost never maintain this)
- [Keybase][kb]

<!-- - [Public Key][pubkey] -->

If you *do* have my phone number, you *should*, but by no means *must*, use
[Signal] to text me. Again, it’s more a habit thing than anything else; normal
texts are also fine.

## Social Policy

I have believed in the virtues of a strong and diverse social graph since the
day I moved to Utah and found myself without any local friends. Please feel free
to interact with me through any of these media and I will do my best to respond
in kind.

If you are geographically near† me, I will gladly hang out with you at least
twice in any setting you like. I am fine with catching a meal or drinks, and I
always love anything outdoors or otherwise scenic. I am a fairly tall man and I
recognize what this implies for a lot of people’s decision-making process, so
here are some explicit promises:

- I will never ask for a non-public setting, nor will I approach to within my
  arms’ reach without invitation.
- At your discretion, you may freely suggest a less than public setting, or
  step closer.
- I will not initiate physical contact but I accept the usual American fare of
  handshakes and hugs.

†: I have a relatively loose definition of “near”, and I usually broadcast my
movements on Twitter. This offer absolutely stands when I am traveling as well
as when I am home.
