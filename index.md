# Alexander Payne

Pronouns: he/him

## Introduction

I’m a programmer and Boy Scout currently living in Arlington, VA. When I’m not
at work or in the wilderness, I like to [write Rust][crates], SCUBA dive,
carpent, tell my cat how good he is, drive across the continent, and listen to
way, way too much girlpop.

I’m currently employed as a software development engineer at Amazon Web
Services, where I work on bringing Rust to embedded devices. I previously worked
at Space Dynamics Laboratory as a satellite software engineer, developing flight
and ground-control software for research satellites.

I also volunteer with a local Scout troop, teaching aquatics and wilderness
travel.

## Contact Info

You may reach me through any of the methods listed here. My phone number, like
that of most Americans, is relentlessly spammed so I don’t broadcast it anymore.
You are welcome, but by no means required, to use my public key. It’s a good
idea but an irritating practice.

- [Email][email]
- [Twitter][twitter]
- [GitHub][gh]
- [Reddit][reddit]
- [Instagram][ig]
- [Snapchat][snap]
- [LinkedIn][linkedin] (I almost never maintain this)

## Social Policy

I have believed in the virtues of a strong and diverse social graph since the
day I moved to Utah and found myself without any local friends. Please feel free
to interact with me through any of these media and I will do my best to respond
in kind.

If you are geographically near† me, I will gladly hang out with you at least
twice in any setting you like. I am fine with catching a meal or drinks, and I
always love anything outdoors or otherwise scenic. I am a fairly tall man and I
recognize what this implies for a lot of people’s decision-making process, so
here are some explicit promises:

- I will never ask for a non-public setting, nor will I approach to within my
  arms’ reach.
- At your discretion, you may freely suggest a less than public setting, or
  step closer.
- I will not initiate physical contact but I accept the usual American fare of
  handshakes and hugs.

†: I have a relatively loose definition of “near”, and I usually broadcast my
movements on Twitter. This offer absolutely stands when I am traveling as well
as when I am home.
