summary: Here are some of my friends.
---

Back when the internet was <del>good</del> <ins>younger</ins>, people with
similar sites [clustered together][wiki]. Between search engines and centralized
social media, this practice is pretty much obsolete (but with federation, maybe
itâ€™s coming back? Who knows!).

Anyway, here are some friends I think are neat.
